                    <p class="text-faded">Healthcare Maps is a visualization tool that helps you get informed about the cost and care quality of hospitals across the United States. By using this tool, you can interactively learn about the cost effectiveness of your selected hospital and the geogrpahic variation in cost and care quality. In summary, Healthcare Maps aims to help you become an empowered citizen who can make the right decision when selecting your own hospital and raise the voice for change in the US healthcare system.</p>

                    <h3><b><ins>Introduction</ins></b></h3><br>
                    In 2009, the U.S. government launched a website called data.gov with the goal of increasing public access to high value, machine readable datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. As part of the movement, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) publicized data for Hospital Compare, which has quality of care data at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals across the country. With abudance of data on quality measures across the U.S, data.gov created an opporuntity for us to analyze the American healthcare industry by creating a meaningful visualization. At the same time, we aimed to creating a tool that would help ordinary citizens make a better decision when it comes to selecting their own hospital. It is in this spirit, we set out to make a visualization tool that would create values for others and achieve open government data innovation.

                    <h3><b><ins>Step 1: GeoJSON</ins></b></h3></br>
                    As a first step, we set out to figure out how we can create an interactive map of hospitals. Luckily, D3 supports a file type called GeoJSON that makes rendering of the map easy based on the data structure. However, the path to making these GeoJSON files still required a number of steps. First, we downloaded the geographic data from Natural Earth (naturalearthdata.com) and converted them in a way that would allow us to display the U.S. Map down to county level details. Then, we had the address of over 4000 hospitals available to us through data.gov, but they had to be converted to latitude/longitude before they can be displayed on the map. As a result, we used Python script to call Google Maps API which allowed us to convert postal addresses to latitude/longitude. With these geographic information, we were finally able to create a complete set of GeoJSON data that would not only map the US map, but also map over thousands of Medicare-certified hospitals onto the map.

                    <h3><b><ins>Step 2: Spending Data</ins></b></h3></br>
                    We obtained the spending data based on 2013 Medicare survey on "Provider Utilization and Payment". Medicare conducted survey on over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals regarding the cost of per episoide of care. Medicare defines episode of care as any series of treatment given to hospitalized patients for 30-day period. For each hospital, Medicare had collected the average cost of care per episode and its breakdown. Therefore, we believed this would serve as a good proxy to measure how expensive each hospital is. TO obtain the data, we parsed through the csv and created a dictionary that pairs each hospital with the average cost of treatment. 
                    <h3><b><ins>Step 3: Quality Data</ins></b></h3></br>
                    Obtaining quality data was a very strenuous process because measurement of care quality is an ongoing research topic that is even widely debated in academia. As for the the Medicare's dataset, it contained the following four categories of quality measures: 1)Readmissions, Complications, and Deaths; 2) Healthcare Associated Infections 3)Timely and Effective Treatment; 4)Patient Satisfaction. Each category of these measures also contained about 20 to 30 different individual measures that probed different aspects of the qualuty. It was a difficult process to determine how we would interpret and process the data since not all information were available to each hospital and we even if the information were available, they were not standardized. In the end, we decided to use Readmissions, Complications, and Deaths data as our proxy for care quality. Our decision was driven by two factors. One factor was that Readmissions, Complications, and Deaths were the most available and quantitative data that promised its potential to be standardized. Another factor was that even in the real world, these measures play a huge role in determining the quality of the hospital. Depending on how frequent readmissions, complications, and deaths occur at a hospital, the hospital could face possible medical lawsuits and penalty from Medicare, which proved to be a good sign that this measure could serve as a strong indicator of care quality. Therefore, we standardized the score by calculating the mean and standard deviation for each measure so that we can calculate the aggregate z-score for each hospital. 
                    <h3><b><ins>Step 4: Demographic Data</ins></b></h3></br>
                    In addition to the hospital data, we also decided to shine a light on demographic data of the region in which the hospital is located. This is because geographic variation in healthcare quality and cost is a prevalent issue in the United States. We were aware of the fact that states with more elders, racial minorities, and low-income households are inclined to have worse access to affordable and good quality healthcare. Therefore, we also wanted to observe such geographic variation and be able to point out on county level which groups are facing this issue. To obtain demographic data, we went to the US Census to download both state and county level population data.  
                    <h3><b><ins>Step 5: Deriving Meanings from Data</ins></b></h3></br>
                    Finally, now that we gathered all the required data, we had to combine and visualize data to derive meaningful insights. Since we had started with the goal to help ordinary citizens make better decision when it comes to selecting their own hospitals, we focused our effort to show the comparison of hospitals in such a way that would help inform the users about whether their selected hospitals are cost effective compared to their county level, state level, and national level.
